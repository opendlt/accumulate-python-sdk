Auto-generated Coverage and Stability Tests

This directory contains tests automatically generated by the Accumulate SDK
Green Gate auto-repair system to improve test coverage and fix validation issues.

These tests are:
- Safe to delete if not needed
- Automatically regenerated when coverage is below threshold
- Designed to be lightweight and focus on missing code branches
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

Generated by: unified/scripts/auto_fix.py
Part of: unified/scripts/green_gate.py

The Green Gate orchestrator may create tests here to achieve the 85% coverage
threshold required for all-green validation.
